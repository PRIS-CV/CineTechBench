The lighting is natural and bright, emphasizing the clear sky and creating stark shadows on the subject's face, which adds to the dramatic effect.\n\nThe color palette is dominated by earth tones, with the brown suit contrasting against the blue sky, enhancing the rustic and grounded feel of the scene. The use of natural light highlights the textures in the man’s clothing and the landscape, bringing out details that contribute to realism.\n\nThe framing includes vertical elements (the poles and the structure) that guide the viewer’s eye towards the character, reinforcing his importance in the scene.
